# Stress Field Calculator
A program which calculated the stress field for given functions and grid.

UPDATE:

The program now includes the anlytic element for gravity, and it produces the Cartisian stress field (&sigma;_{11}, \sigma_{22} & \sigma_12). $`\sqrt{2}`$ &psi;

The user will have to define the funciton files for the stresses. The program will the use those to calculate and export the stress field for a given grid.
